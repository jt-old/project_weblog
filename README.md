# Justin's WebLog

An example blog app where I learned more about:

- HTTP Requests
  - URLs, endpoints,
  - Methods,
  - Headers
- REST APIs
  - Resources
  - Parameters
  - Queries

Project uses the [JSONPLaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to render the first 10 example blog posts.

Users can add a title and body text to the form and click "Post" to post new blogs to the form.
